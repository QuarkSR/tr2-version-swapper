## Information
This package contains a script which automates switching between TR2 PC game versions.

The script does the following:
* Checks its surroundings before proceeding, giving guidance if things seem wrong
* Prompts you to select a version to switch to
* Performs copy operations to switch to your chosen version

The necessary version files/folders will be provided in releases only.

> If you can successfully copy-paste all necessary files to and from the correct folders when switching versions, you don't *need* the script -- but it'll save clicks/keystrokes/time.

**Current version list**
 * Steam default Multipatch
 * Eidos Premier Collection [EPC]
 * Eidos UK Box [UKB]

## Installation
Place the entire `tr2-version-swapper` folder (not just its inner contents) into the root of your TR2 installation.
The default Steam installation path is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Tomb Raider (II)`.
You can navigate there manually with File Explorer or a similar program.

**Alternatively, from within Steam:**
* Navigate to your Steam library
* Right-click Tomb Raider II in the left pane
* Select Properties
* Select the Local Files tab
* Select Browse Local Files

## Usage
**Be sure you installed this folder properly.**
> The folder `tr2-version-swapper` should be inside your TR2 installation's main folder.

**To swap versions:**
* Run the batch file by double-clicking `tr2-version-swapper` (it may show the extension `.bat` if this setting is on)
* Read and respond to the command window text as prompted

**If you have permissions errors or other issues, try running the script as administrator:**
* Right-click the batch file
* Select "Run as administrator"
