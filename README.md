## Information
This package contains a batch script that automates swapping and patching Tomb Raider II PC game versions.

> This script is not intended for use with CD-based installations; use it only with digital distributions of TR2 (Steam, GOG) on Windows.
> At this time, no Linux release exists and there is only one known Mac version currently available.

The script does the following:
* Checks its surroundings before proceeding, giving guidance if things seem wrong
* Prompts you to select a version to switch to, then applies that version
* Prompts about the optional Patch 1, then applies it if desired
* Prompts about the optional music fix, then applies it if desired

Releases contain installation and usage instructions.

> If you can successfully copy-paste all required files to and from the correct folders when switching versions, you don't *need* the script -- but it can save clicks/keystrokes/time.

Assets for the following versions and utilities are provided in releases only:

**Versions**
 * Multipatch
 * Eidos Premier Collection [EPC]
 * Eidos UK Box [UKB]

**Utilities**
 * Patch 1
 * Music Fix
